# C++ Reminder on ESP32 with IDF

## Description
This document serves as a reminder and guide for working with C++ on an ESP32 using the Espressif IoT Development Framework (ESP-IDF).

## Objective
The main objective is to remember key concepts of C++ and how to apply them specifically in the ESP32 development environment with IDF. Topics covered include setting up the development environment, creating classes and objects, using pointers, dynamic memory management, and interacting with ESP-WROOM-32.

## Contents
1. Creating classes and objects in C++
    - Definition of classes.
    - Declaration of objects.
    - Class methods and attributes.

2. Using pointers and dynamic memory management
    - Pointer concept in C++.
    - Dynamic memory allocation and deallocation.
    - Considerations for memory management in an embedded environment.
